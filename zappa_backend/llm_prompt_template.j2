Act as an expert in policy analysis and public administration. Based on the summaries—each of which includes a sentiment label (Positive or Negative)—provide a structured synthesis as follows:

1. Overview of the Core Issue:
Analyze and summarize the main policy issue or problem being addressed across all snippets. Identify any common patterns, challenges, or objectives.

2. Synthesis of Negative Sentiment Summaries (if any):
If there are summaries marked with Negative sentiment, synthesize their key concerns, criticisms, or negative impacts. Focus on recurring issues or points of tension.

3. Synthesis of Positive Sentiment Summaries (if any):
If there are summaries marked with Positive sentiment, synthesize the benefits, improvements, or favorable outcomes being highlighted.

If either the negative or positive category is not present in the snippets, clearly indicate that no such summaries were identified.
